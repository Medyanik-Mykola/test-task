# test-task
This project is a test assignment where I developed a responsive website based on a given design mockup.  The project was implemented using HTML, CSS, and modern responsive design techniques such as media queries and flexible layouts. Key features include clean code structure, pixel-perfect design matching the mockup, and adaptability across multiple devices.
